# Week 11

## Class Outline

### Introduction
- Continuing with CartoDB
  - Torque for time series
  - SQL for persistent data changes

### CartoDB Torque lab
Torque.js is an open source library for creating dynamic visualizations for
your time series data on top of Leaflet (and with the help of CartoDB).
If you're dealing with time and space, Torque can build compelling
visualizations ranging over both dimensions.

### CartoDB Advanced SQL lab
> Keeping API keys in client applications is NOT a safe practice.
> Do NOT use the techniques practiced in this lab in the wild.

Persisting data with CartoDB is very easy. We'll take a look at how it
can be done and practice building an application which manages user
input.
